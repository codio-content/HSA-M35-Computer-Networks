Graph theory is a mathematical field that helps the describe the connections between people, places, and in computer science, computers.  For the following activity we will use graph theory to create graphs of people we know.

# Node
A node is a point on a graph.  
This can be a person or computer for our example.

# Edge
An edge is a line that connects two nodes.  
In our example, an edge represents people who know each other.
In computer networks, an edge could represent a wired or wireless connection.

- Create a graph with yourself in the center and your family members as nodes.
- Draw edges connecting all of your family members.
- Add your friends to the graph, do all of your family members know all of your friends?

# Question 1
Does everyone in your family know everyone else?  Are there members that are too young to have direct communication? Most two-year-olds do not have their own phone.

If everyone is connected to everyone else, this is called a complete graph and in networking terms, it is very robust.  If one connection was broken (you lost a phone number) a message could still be delivered through others in your network.

# Question 2
How does this graph compare to the graph of only your family?

# Question 3
If you lose your phone, how could you get a message to your most distant friend?

This type of computer network is easier to make, fewer connections and wires but it is more likely to fail.
