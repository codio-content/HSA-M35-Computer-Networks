As a message or packet of data travels across a network, it is routed by various network devices such as routers, switches, hubs, bridges, and an array of other pieces of communication hardware.

## Packets of Data
The data in a website, document, video, or song is too big to be sent all at once.  The data is broken down into smaller packets of information that can be reassembled once all the packets have reached their destination.  Each packet is given a destination, and other information based on the protocols of the service being used to send the data.

## Routing
As the data packets travel between two computers, it will travel through a complicated series of cables, wires, and even wireless channels to reach its final destination.  The exact routing is determined by the remote servers, switches, hubs, routers, and other hardware as it travels across a network.  The route is not pre-planned nor is it guaranteed to be the most efficient or quickest.

Sometimes data is lost in the transmission, in these cases, the requesting computer simply requests a new packet be sent by the server.

## Topologies
The way computers are connected is sometimes referred to as their topology.  For example, a star topology consists of a centralized piece of hardware that several computers are plugged into.  Even if the computers are not spread out in a star shape, we can imagine the shape of a star.

In examining topologies, we can study the effects of hardware failure at key points.  How many computers would be affected by a power outage or hardware failure?  Addressing these questions help network and security professionals maintain a reliable network.
